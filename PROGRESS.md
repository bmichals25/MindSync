# MindSync Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created React Native project with Expo and TypeScript
   - Set up folder structure according to architecture document
   - Added necessary dependencies
   - Configuration for TypeScript, linting
   - Set up version control with GitHub

2. **Basic Structure & Components**
   - Created color and layout constants
   - Created API constants
   - Implemented type definitions
   - Created core UI components:
     - Button
     - Card
     - MessageBubble
     - ActionItem
     - MoodSelector

3. **Navigation**
   - Implemented navigation structure
   - Set up stack and tab navigators
   - Created navigation flow for auth and main app

4. **Screens**
   - Implemented Home screen
   - Implemented Chat screen
   - Implemented Voice screen
   - Implemented Session Recap screen
   - Implemented Settings screen
   - Implemented Login screen
   - Implemented Register screen

5. **State Management**
   - Set up Redux with Redux-Persist
   - Created slice architecture for state management
   - Implemented auth slice with mock authentication
   - Implemented sessions slice for therapy sessions
   - Implemented mood tracking slice
   - Implemented settings slice
   - Implemented UI state slice
   - Created TypeScript hooks for type-safe Redux access

6. **API Integration**
   - Created API services for OpenAI
   - Created API services for ElevenLabs TTS

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Type Issues**
   - Install additional type definitions if needed
   - Resolve any remaining TypeScript errors

2. **Connect Redux Store to UI**
   - Connect Login/Register screens to auth state
   - Connect Chat screen to sessions state
   - Connect Home screen to moods state
   - Connect Settings screen to settings state

3. **Enhance API Integration**
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement secure storage for API keys
   - Create environment variable setup for API keys

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - Implement actual authentication logic (or continue with mock for MVP)
   - Add auth guards to protected routes

5. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for screens
   - Test on iOS and Android

6. **UI Polish**
   - Add animations
   - Improve styling
   - Add responsive design

7. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement actual AI conversations
   - Implement voice recording and processing
   - Implement mood analytics

## Current Limitations

- App is primarily set up with the UI structure, but many functions are mocked
- Authentication is simulated (no actual backend)
- AI responses are mocked (no actual API calls to OpenAI)
- Voice functionality is not fully implemented
- Data persistence is configured but not fully utilized
